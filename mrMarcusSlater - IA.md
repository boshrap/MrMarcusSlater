	|What am I Like?


	|What do I like?
	Unprofroessionally, I'm an enthusiast. I love the internet and comptuers like a fascinated child still. I'm a hardcore, lifelong gamer with a lot of opinions. I love driving and good roads--so much so, that I wrote about cars for years and daily drive a Miata. Predicatbly, I'm also a lifelong anime enthusiast with, again, _lots_ of opinions.
