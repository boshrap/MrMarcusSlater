                    <h5>Online Access App â€“ Dashboard UI Updates & Pendo Guide</h5>
                    <strong>Role</strong>
                    <p>Several revisions to the design of the Online Access app were being implemented. My role was to advise on changes to the navigation menu, and provide instruction for users to navigate the changes.<p> 

                    <p>We settled on using Pendo to deliver a 3 page wizard to guide users through the new changes. The first page informaed the user that thei menu had changed, and that several of the previous menu items had been moved to the Settings page. The copy mentioned the previous menu items by name and featured a diagram showing where they could find their new items.</p> 
                    <p>The second page was more about introducing the redesigned UI of the settings page. I had worked on the content for these pages, so I was familiar with what changes were being made. The space in the Peno guide was small though, so I mentioned the new features first and finished with a call to action to "see what's new."</p>

                    <p> The third page was a stakeholder request to remind users where they can find a link to a highly-trafficed financial report on their dashboard. Though the link hadn't moved in the redesign, the stakeholders felt it would be beneficial to let customers know their favorite link is in the same spot. I agreed and so the Pendo guide was complete.</p>

                    <p>This project went well with no edits from project management and legal. We managed to incorporate all the requests from stakeholders while delivering a new, simplified UX. </p>
