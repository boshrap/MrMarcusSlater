                    <h5>Seville Classics – eCommerce & Retail Content Strategy</h5>
                    <strong>eCommerce & Retail Content Strategy</strong>     
                    <p>As the ecommerce copywriter, my role was to develop and implement a strategy to develop content for all of Seville Classics ecommerce partners. I started by auditing all the existing content for Seville Classics’ hundred of products into a single, large database. This allowed me to organize the items clearly into their own categories and neatly note their metadata. I used the Amazon detailed item upload spreadsheet as a basis after comparing the various methods for Wayfair, Walmart, Costco, Overstock, and Home Depot. With some adaptations, this spreadsheet served as a basis for me to create content for our products that was consistent across all of our materials—including catalogs, advertising, manuals, assembly instructions and more. It was the first time that content had been centralized at Seville Classics.</p> 
                    <p>From there, I followed a process to develop new content for existing and future items: 1) do a comparative analysis between top competitors. Note their titles, keywords, feature bullets, descriptions and specifications. 2) Identify the strengths, threats, opportunities and weaknesses between our product and the competition. Make note of these and apply this rationale to your copy. 3) Create a product description that contains all important information, materials, keywords, specifications and warnings that are necessary. Be descriptive. Then, edit this into a shorter version less than 500 characters. 4) Create feature bullets that target users at the “consideration”  stage of the marketing funnel. Use the previous analysis to win the comparison, or at least drive interest to continue scrolling. 5) Adapt this copy into the various templates as needed with the appropriate keywords. Templates between retailers vary, so you may need to reformat/retrofit the long version of your description. </p> 
                    
                    <p> This general strategy was successful as a rubric for creating ecommerce content for items across categories. It was also easy to track which keywords were effective and popular, and adjust them as needed.</p>
