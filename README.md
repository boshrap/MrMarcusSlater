Howdy! If you're here, you may be interested in hiring me. This is the public repo of my portfolio homepage.

I didn't want it to just be a bunch of text on Wordpress since it's pretty easy to just pick a template.

Instead, I wanted to host something handmade and useful for practice. Front-end design and programming are not my primary skills... But it is a fun and useful hobby when you're a tech writer. My dad was a software engineer and, while I don't mind coding, I don't want to be one. But hey! Good hobbies make good skills, and this world is more interesting with versatile people. 

Here's my plan for this page,

The requirements: 
1. Identify myself to people.
2. Give them an easy way to get in touch.
3. Provide a section for work examples.

Technical requirements:
1. Single page website
2. Use a CSS framework as proof of ability (Bootstrap is EASY), also speed.
3. Style page in Figma first. Use general design to inform page programming.
4. Make it so. (I did.)

Future updates:
1. Chatbot, rules based. Actually really easy with the help of llama. Was considering something more sophisticated like Botpress, but honestly, just answering questions about my work history would be more efficient and easier to make. AI is way, way, way overkill... (But it is fun, so I might make an AI Marcus.) 
2. Remake case studies for web. PDFs are heavy and unnecessary. Would fine/better on a responsive page.
