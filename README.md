This is the living repo for my resume website.

I didn't want it to just be a bunch of text on Wordpress sicne it's pretty easy to just pick a template.

Instead, I wanted to host something handmade and useful for practice. Front-end design and programming are not my primary skills... But it is a fun and useful hobby when you're a tech writer.

The requirements: 
1. Identify myself to people.
2. Give them an easy way to get in touch.
3. Provide a section for work examples.

Technical requirements:
1. Single page website
2. Use a CSS framework as proof of ability (Bootstrap is EASY), also speed.
3. Style page in Figma first. Abandon that design. THEN mimic style used for case studies.

Future updates:
1. Create more case studies offline.
2. Remake case studies for web.
3. React SPA style page with navigable sections.
