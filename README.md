This is the living repo for my resume website.

I didn't want it to just be a bunch of text on Wordpress. It's pretty easy to just pick a template.

Instead, I wanted to build something that would prove that I have some modern web coding ability. It's easy for people to make assumptions when you're a writer.

The requirements: 
1. Identify myself to people.
2. Give them an easy way to get in touch.
3. Provide a section for work examples 

Technical requirements:
1. Single page website
2. Use a CSS framework as proof of ability (Bootstrap is EASY), also speed.
3. Style page in Figma first. Abandon that design. THEN mimic style used for case studies.

Future ugpdates:
1. Add more case studies
2. Code the case studies into single page apps
3. redesign file cabinet
